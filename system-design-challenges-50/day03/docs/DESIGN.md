# System Design - Day 3 - Feedback-Driven System Design Portal

## Overview
This document outlines the design approach for the Feedback-Driven System Design Portal. The system allows users to submit design questions and receive feedback, with the system evolving based on that feedback.

## Architecture Components

### Core Services
1. **Question Service**: Manages the creation, retrieval, and updating of design questions
2. **Feedback Service**: Handles user feedback submission and retrieval
3. **Analytics Service**: Tracks question performance and generates insights
4. **Scoring Service**: Calculates question rankings based on multiple factors

### Data Layer
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database for storing questions, feedback, and user data
- **Redis**: Caching layer for frequently accessed data and session storage

### Infrastructure
- **Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic across multiple application instances
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes for managing deployments and scaling
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana for system metrics and dashboards

## API Design

### Question Endpoints
- `POST /questions/` - Create a new question
- `GET /questions/` - Retrieve all questions
- `GET /questions/{id}` - Retrieve a specific question

### Feedback Endpoints
- `POST /feedback/` - Submit feedback for a question
- `GET /feedback/{question_id}` - Retrieve feedback for a question

### Analytics Endpoints
- `POST /analytics/track-view/{question_id}` - Track a view for a question
- `POST /analytics/track-feedback/{question_id}` - Track feedback for a question
- `GET /analytics/{question_id}` - Get analytics for a specific question
- `GET /analytics/` - Get analytics for all questions

## Scoring Algorithm
The scoring algorithm considers multiple factors:
1. **Average Rating** (40% weight): Based on user feedback ratings
2. **View Count** (30% weight): Popularity indicator
3. **Feedback Volume** (20% weight): Engagement level
4. **Recency Factor** (10% weight): Newer questions get a slight boost

## Scaling Strategy
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Multiple application instances behind a load balancer
- **Database Sharding**: Questions partitioned by creation date
- **Caching**: Redis caches frequently accessed questions and analytics
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Background workers handle non-critical tasks

## Failure Scenarios and Mitigations
1. **Database Failure**: Implement read replicas and automatic failover
2. **Cache Failure**: Gracefully degrade to database queries
3. **High Traffic**: Auto-scaling based on CPU and memory usage
4. **Worker Backlog**: Scale worker pods based on queue depth

## Security Considerations
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Authentication and authorization for admin functions
- Secure database connections with SSL/TLS
