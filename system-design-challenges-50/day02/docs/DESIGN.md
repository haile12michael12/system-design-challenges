# Weather Dashboard Design Document

## Overview
This document outlines the design of a scalable weather dashboard system that can handle 1 million users with 99.99% uptime. The system focuses on non-functional requirements such as scalability, availability, and performance.

## System Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Display current weather conditions for any city
2. Show weather forecasts for the next 14 days
3. Allow users to set preferences (favorite cities, temperature units)
4. Provide weather alerts and notifications
5. Support multiple data sources for weather information

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Scalability**: Support 1M daily active users with peak load of 10,000 requests/second
2. **Availability**: 99.99% uptime (less than 52.6 minutes downtime per year)
3. **Latency**: 95th percentile response time under 200ms
4. **Durability**: All user data must be persisted with backups
5. **Security**: HTTPS, input validation, protection against common web vulnerabilities
6. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive metrics and health checks

## Architecture Overview

### High-Level Architecture
```
[Users] -> [Load Balancer] -> [Nginx] -> [FastAPI App] -> [Redis Cache]
                                               ↓
                                        [PostgreSQL DB]
                                               ↓
                                     [Background Workers]
```

### Component Details

#### API Layer
- **FastAPI Application**: Main service handling HTTP requests
- **Nginx**: Reverse proxy for load balancing and SSL termination
- **Rate Limiting**: Token bucket algorithm to prevent abuse

#### Data Layer
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database for user preferences and account data
- **Redis**: In-memory cache for weather data and session storage
- **Data Replication**: Master-slave setup for read scaling

#### Application Layer
- **Business Logic**: Services implementing weather data processing
- **Background Workers**: Asynchronous tasks for data fetching
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-level caching with TTL

#### Monitoring & Observability
- **Metrics Collection**: Custom collector tracking key metrics
- **Health Checks**: Component-level monitoring
- **Logging**: Structured logging for debugging
- **Alerting**: Notification system for issues

## Data Model

### User Preferences
```
UserPreferences {
  user_id: int
  favorite_cities: List[str]
  temperature_unit: str  // Celsius or Fahrenheit
  notifications_enabled: bool
}
```

### Weather Data
```
WeatherData {
  id: int
  city: str
  temperature: float
  humidity: float
  pressure: float
  wind_speed: float
  timestamp: datetime
  condition: str
}
```

### Forecast Data
```
ForecastData {
  city: str
  forecast: List[WeatherData]
  last_updated: datetime
}
```

## API Design

### Endpoints
1. `GET /weather/{city}` - Get current weather
2. `GET /forecast/{city}` - Get weather forecast
3. `POST /preferences` - Set user preferences
4. `GET /preferences/{user_id}` - Get user preferences
5. `GET /health` - Health check
6. `GET /metrics` - System metrics

### Error Handling
- 400 Bad Request: Invalid input
- 404 Not Found: City not found
- 500 Internal Server Error: System error
- 503 Service Unavailable: System overloaded

## Scalability Strategy

### Horizontal Scaling
- Stateless API services for easy scaling
- Load balancing across multiple instances
- Database read replicas for scaling reads

### Caching
- Redis cache for weather data with TTL
- CDN for static assets
- API response caching

### Database Sharding
- Shard by geographic region
- Separate tables for historical data

### Auto-scaling
- Scale based on CPU and memory usage
- Scale based on request queue length

## Availability Strategy

### Redundancy
- Multiple API service instances
- Database replication
- Multiple Redis instances

### Failover
- Automatic failover for database
- Health checks for all services
- Circuit breaker pattern

### Backup
- Regular database backups
- Cross-region replication

## Performance Optimization

### Database
- Connection pooling
- Proper indexing
- Query optimization

### Caching
- Multi-level caching
- Cache warming
- Cache invalidation strategy

### Network
- CDN for static assets
- Compression for responses
- HTTP/2 support

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- API keys for external services
- User authentication for preferences

### Input Validation
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Validate API parameters

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest
- Encryption in transit (HTTPS)

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics
- Request rate and latency
- Error rates
- System resource usage
- Database performance

### Health Checks
- Service health endpoints
- Database connectivity
- Cache availability

### Logging
- Structured logging
- Log aggregation
- Log retention policies

## Deployment

### Environment
- Docker containers for consistency
- Docker Compose for local development
- Kubernetes for production deployment

### CI/CD
- Automated testing
- Automated deployment
- Rollback strategy

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Features
- Machine learning for weather predictions
- Personalized recommendations
- Social features for sharing weather

### Infrastructure Improvements
- Multi-region deployment
- Serverless functions for background tasks
- GraphQL API for flexible data fetching
